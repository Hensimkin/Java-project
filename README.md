# Zoo Management System

Welcome to the **Zoo Management System** project! This Java-based application is a comprehensive exploration of:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Multithreading**
- **Design Patterns**
- **Java Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project simulates a zoo management system with an interactive GUI, providing a hands-on experience with Java's core concepts and advanced features.

### Key Features

- **OOP Principles**: Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Multithreading**: Implements concurrent processing for efficient task management.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes patterns like Singleton, Observer, and Factory to promote reusable and maintainable code.
- **Java GUI**: Offers an intuitive interface using Swing/AWT for seamless user interaction.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- **Enhance Java Skills**: Serve as a practical platform to apply and reinforce Java programming skills.
- **Understand Core Principles**: Deepen understanding of OOP, multithreading, and design patterns.
- **Develop GUI Applications**: Gain experience in building user-friendly interfaces.
